# Election_Analysis using Python




## Overview of Election Audit: 
 * Election Audit of a local Colorado Congressional Election.  We were provided with a CSV file of Election data.  We used Python to automate reading the CSV file, performing an analysis on the election data, and writing results to a text file.

## Election-Audit Summary: 

>The Local Colorado congressional election included three candidates and election results from three counties. 
* Winning Candidate 1:  Diana DeGette (272,892 votes, 73.8% of the vote)
* Candidate 2:  Charles Casper Stockham (85,213 votes, 23% of the vote)
* Candidate 3:  Raymon Anthony Doane (11,606 votes, 3.1% of the vote)
* COUNTY 1:  Denver County (306,055 votes cast, 82.8% of votes cast)
* COUNTY 2:  Jefferson County (38,855 votes cast, 10.5% of votes cast)
* COUNTY 3:  Arapahoe County (24,801 votes cast, 6.7% of votes cast)

Using Python, we were able to read the "election_resuls" CSV file, count votes, calculate the winner, calculate voter participation per county and write results to a text file called "election_analysis".  The analysis could potentially be used to determine voter engagment, candidate viability, voter accessability and many other aspects to voting and local elections.  The Python code could be modified to perform further analysis if provided more data.
